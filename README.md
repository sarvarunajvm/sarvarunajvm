# 👋, Am Saravanan Kalimuthu
I like experimenting with new technologies, building small projects, and occassionally joining hackathons. ✨

Here's a list of things I currently keep myself busy with:

- 👩🏻‍💻 Working as a full stack developer over at **[AssetPulse](https://www.assetpulse.com/)** using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- ☀️ Maintaining **[Gem-Of-config](httpshttps://github.com/sarvarunajvm/gem-of-config)**, and **[Gem-Of-config](httpshttps://github.com/sarvarunajvm/gem-of-config)** to speed up the project creation)
- ✍️ Writing tech blog posts over at **[dev.to](https://dev.to/sarvarunajvm)**.
- 🛠 Getting myself into Devops. Trying out [Azure Devops](https://dev.azure.com/sarvaruna/) and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) in my spare time.
